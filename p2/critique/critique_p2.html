            Blaze Pizza's landing page is very direct in its approach.
            It's uncluttered, and nearly every link takes you through the linear ordering process they use - picking a location,
            then either selecting a preset pizza or choosing the dough, sauce, toppings, and extras.
            This approach makes navigation very straightforward, and it being complemented both by a simple color scheme
            (mainly just sticking to white and their logo's orange color) and a very clean interface make me appreciate its overall simplicity.

        <p>
            Panda Express manages to be even more direct than Blaze's - the landing page opens with a prominent animated hero image filling the entire screen advertising their newest menu item,
            allowing you to add it to your order straight away.
      	</p>
      	<p>
            From the menu, you're quickly able to add items to a nutritional calculator,
            and the ordering process is quick and intuitive - single items can be quickly added with one button press, and building a bowl or plate is a only requires a few clicks/taps.
            Overall, I'm impressed with the speed and ease of navigation of this site.
            The color scheme mainly sticks to shades of red and a shade of orange that, pleasingly, can be seen in all their entrees.
        </p>
        <p>
        	I also personally feel it's worth mentioning that they do offer links to their mobile app on the site, and yet the site makes no sacrifices in its mobile layout. I have a certain respect for sites that continue to prove that a mobile site doesn't have to be inferior to a mobile app in terms of performance and usability.

            Domino's Pizza's landing page, while being grid-based like Blaze and Panda's, gives significantly more cluttered first impressions. I was trying to figure out what made me feel this way about it, but then I realized it specifically had to do with the images they were using. Each of them have at least four text elements overlaid on them - an "Order Now" button, a button describing what the deal is it's advertising, a bit of additional text in a small font, and a price in a large font. 
        </p>
        <p>
        	The ordering process is a bit more convoluted than Blaze's, though some of this comes from them offering quite a bit more than just pizza. Their pizza-building interface offers a visual reference for (most) toppings, cheeses, and sauces. It gets progressively more cluttered as you add toppings, as additional information is added on screen to choose a density and half of the pizza for each topping. All in all, like the rest of the site, it has the potential to be intuitive, but it never quite makes it there.

        <p>
            After comparing Blaze's interface to Domino's, I decided that I wanted to see how other pizza restaurants compared. As it turns out, Papa John's navigation, and indeed its site as whole, is essentially a more modernized version of Domino's. It makes full use of the screen, uses much simpler images that fully convey what you are ordering. Getting to the point where you can order pizza is a quick, simple process, and the landing page even changes after you have an order in your cart to show additional offers. I appreciate the fact that the whole site retains a certain visual consistency, regardless of where you navigate to, allowing the site's layout to be easy to learn.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            As for the menu layout, items are categorized at the top, keeping things from being unnecessarily cluttered. When creating your own pizza, you are once again given a visual reference, as well as a much more intuitive, mobile-friendly layout. Like the Domino's site, you are given choices to modify topping amounts and halves of the pizza, but it's, again, significantly more intuitive.

        <div class="row">
            <img class="column desktop" src="img/LittleCaesars_Desktop.png">
            <img class="column mobile" src="img/LittleCaesars_Mobile.png">

        <p>
            Little Caesars offers a return to the simplicity found with Blaze's landing page. The majority of the page consists of only three elements - one to start your order (proclaiming that they deliver), one advertising how you can save at least $5 on deliveries through them (with plenty of fine print below that), and one advertising how their "Extramostbestest" pizza is Only $1...more than their Classic pizza. Underneath these elements, options are given to go directly to their pizza styles, their sides, and their pizza creator. Like Papa John's, Little Caesar's menu is divided into categories. Preset pizzas are divided between their Large Round pizzas and Deep!Deep! Dish pizzas in these categories.
        </p>
        <p>
        	Choosing to create your own from here opens their pizza creation interface - possibly the simplest of them all. You are presented with all the possible options at once. While this easily end up being a cluttered affair, this is avoided by only having one per row, resulting in finding the toppings you want only requiring a quick scroll. Further simplification is made by making the choice of a topping be done by immediately choosing if you want it on the whole pie or one half, rather than hiding this under a menu. Other parameters, such as crust type and sauce amount, are on the right half of the screen on desktop and at the bottom on mobile, distinctly marked with their orange background. It's an overall fast, simple experience.
        </p>
        <p>
        	Overall, Little Caesars probably has the most intuitive interface of all the sites I visited, never requiring you to look very far to find what you're looking for. This simplicity is carried over into their color scheme, only stepping outside of their use of single shades of white, orange, and black for light grey buttons. I am impressed by the overall avoidance of overcomplication that is found here.
