            Blaze Pizza's landing page is very direct in its approach.
            It's uncluttered, and nearly every link takes you through the linear ordering process they use - picking a location,
            then either selecting a preset pizza or choosing the dough, sauce, toppings, and extras.
            This approach makes navigation very straightforward, and it being complemented both by a simple color scheme
            (mainly just sticking to white and their logo's orange color) and a very clean interface make me appreciate its overall simplicity.

            <img class="column desktop" src="img/PandaExpress_Desktop.png">
            <img class="column mobile" src="img/PandaExpress_Mobile.png">
        </div>
        <p>
            Panda Express manages to be even more direct than Blaze's - the landing page opens with a prominent animated hero image filling the entire screen advertising their newest menu item,
            allowing you to add it to your order straight away.
            From the menu, you're quickly able to add items to a nutritional calculator,
            and the ordering process is quick and intuitive - single items can be quickly added with one button press, and building a bowl or plate is a only requires a few clicks/taps.
            Overall, I'm impressed with the speed and ease of navigation of this site.
            The color scheme mainly sticks to shades of red and a shade of orange that, pleasingly, can be seen in all their entrees.

        <p>
            The Silver Diner landing page immediately shows an image advertising their catering options, which is a weird choice. 
            If you scroll down, you'll see options to navigate the their customer rewards program, their "flexitarian" menu for 
            customizable dishes, and a quote from a review by Voice of America. The main navigation includes a menu for viewing 
            options, as well as locations so you can visit. However, after selecting a location, you are brought to the menu 
            page again, which is redundant.

        <p>
            The Stevie B's Pizza Buffet landing page immediately shows an image displaying "20 choices Every Day, Every Buffet!" 
            which immediately clues the user into what they're buying. Under this, there are two images, one for the menu, and 
            the other for locations. If you choose the menu, you are brought to a page with different options for takeout. For 
            the locations menu, you are taken to a page with various locations, which you can click on to view and book a party, 
            view directions, and other relevant information. Overall, this website is easy to navigate and the purpose is clear. 
            I find the green, blue and purple color scheme to be a bit too colorful, but as the restaurant is mainly marketed 
            towards parents, the kid-friendly color scheme is a good choice. Otherwise, they could communicate that most 
            locations have an arcade with prizes so that parents know their kids will have fun and stay occupied.

        <p>
            The Panera Bread website landing page shows different images of food that scroll across. On these scrolling images 
            are buttons that for starting an order. The color scheme is good with a green and brown that gives the site a more 
            "homey" feel. The navigation options at the top make it clear that Panera has the goal of making healthy and tasty 
            food. You can hover over the different options in the navigation menu to expand it. Each menu option has details on the 
            food and nutrition, which emphasizes their message of making healthy and tasty food. The ordering process on the website is 
            smooth, with options for drive-through pickup, delivery, or ordering within the restaurant. Overall, the presentation and 
            color scheme is good.
